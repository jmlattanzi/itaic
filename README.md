# ITAIC

### _Is This An Instagram/Imgur Clone?_

[_ITAIC_](https://itaic.co) is an image sharing and uploading service and is a personal project I've been working on and this is the 1.0 build. It is built on React, Redux, Sass, AWS' S3 and SQL. This app has presented a lot of challenges that I hadn't had the opportunity to explore, and has been a great learning experience since day one.

### What does it do?

Users are free to view images and read comments posted by others on the site. With the creation of an account you can upload your own images and make comments on other's posts.

### How's it stacked?

This project is built on an API written in Express.js and uses express-sessions and Bcrypt to manage user sessions. Front-end communication is handled through Redux and the redux-promise-middleware package. Functionality was constructed using React and the styling was done in Sass. Behind everything is a PostgreSQL database.

### What's next

I'm hoping to get version 2 of _ITAIC_ released by May 2019. It will be a major upgrade both in architecture, scalability, and the tech used.
